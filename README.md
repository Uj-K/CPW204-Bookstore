## Getting Started

### Installing TypeScript
- Download and install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
- In the command line, run this command exactly as shown: `npm install -g typescript`

### Compiling TypeScript
To compile the TypeScript files with the watch option, run the following command: `tsc --watch`. 
Using the watch option, only requires us to compile once each time the project is opened.
